- Have you ever met someone you think about
- every night and every day,
- someone so beautiful it's breathtaking
- and words just aren't enough to say?

- Have you ever met someone so special
- you can't imagine life without,
- someone you want to talk forever
- and learn everything about?

- Have you ever met someone just as crazy
- who wanted to have just as much fun,
- someone you can dance all night with
- and together watch the rising sun?

- Have you ever met someone so amazing
- you wish you could pause the time so it doesn't end?
- This someone is you,
- and I'd like you to be my girlfriend.
