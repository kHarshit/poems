- With all that extra time I had,
- With all that extra time...

- I'd buy myself a writing pad,
- And write a pantomime -
- I'd take a walk around the park
- To watch the birds in flight -
- I'd sit and stare, and after dark,
- I'd view the stars at night -
- I'd learn to craft a boat or two
- To sail across the sea -
- I'd find the perfect thing to do
- With me, and only me -
- I'd paint myself a silver scene
- Of homes and hills and lakes -
- I'd make a glossy magazine
- For baking tasty cakes -
- I'd take a swim beyond the shore
- And through the foam and spray -
- The world would be my open door
- With just an extra day.

- With all that extra time to spend,
- To spare, to share, to know -
- I'd live my dreams...
