- If you can keep your head when all about you
- {:.indent-2}Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
- If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
- {:.indent-2}But make allowance for their doubting too;
- If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
- {:.indent-2}Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,
- Or, being hated, don't give way to hating,
- {:.indent-2}And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;

- If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
- {:.indent-2}If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
- If you can meet with triumph and disaster
- {:.indent-2}And treat those two impostors just the same;
- If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
- {:.indent-2}Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
- Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,
- {:.indent-2}And stoop and build 'em up with wornout tools;

- If you can make one heap of all your winnings
- {:.indent-2}And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
- And lose, and start again at your beginnings
- {:.indent-2}And never breathe a word about your loss;
- If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
- {:.indent-2}To serve your turn long after they are gone,
- And so hold on when there is nothing in you
- {:.indent-2}Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on";

- If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
- {:.indent-2}Or walk with kings—nor lose the common touch;
- If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;
- {:.indent-2}If all men count with you, but none too much;
- If you can fill the unforgiving minute
- {:.indent-2}With sixty seconds' worth of distance run—
- Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
- {:.indent-2}And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son!
