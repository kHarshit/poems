- Is anybody happier because you passed his way?
- {:.indent-2}Does anyone remember that you spoke to him today?
- This day is almost over, and its toiling time is through;
- {:.indent-2}Is there anyone to utter now a kindly word of you?
- Did you give a cheerful greeting to the friend who came along?
- Or a churlish sort of "Howdy" and then vanish in the throng?
- Were you selfish pure and simple as you rushed along the way,
- Or is someone mighty grateful for a deed you did today?
- Can you say tonight, in parting with the day that's slipping fast,
- {:.indent-2}That you helped a single brother of the many that you passed?
- Is a single heart rejoicing over what you did or said;
- {:.indent-2}Does a man whose hopes were fading now with courage look ahead?
- Did you waste the day, or lose it, was it well or sorely spent?
- {:.indent-2}Did you leave a trail of kindness or a scar of discontent?
- As you close your eyes in slumber do you think that God would say,
- {:.indent-2}You have earned one more tomorrow by the work you did today?
