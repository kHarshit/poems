- Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
- Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
- Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
- And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
- Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
- And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
- And every fair from fair sometime declines,
- By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
- But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
- Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
- Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
- When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
- So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
- So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

## Footnotes

The above poem in simple English ([source](http://www.shakespeare-online.com/sonnets/18detail.html)):  
> - Shall I compare you to a summer's day?
> - You are more lovely and more constant:
> - Rough winds shake the beloved buds of May
> - And summer is far too short:
> - At times the sun is too hot,
> - Or often goes behind the clouds;
> - And everything beautiful sometime will lose its beauty,
> - By misfortune or by nature's planned out course.
> - But your youth shall not fade,
> - Nor will you lose the beauty that you possess;
> - Nor will death claim you for his own,
> - Because in my eternal verse you will live forever.
> - So long as there are people on this earth,
> - So long will this poem live on, making you immortal.
