- I have named you queen.
- There are taller than you, taller.
- There are purer than you, purer.
- There are lovelier than you, lovelier.
- But you are the queen.

- When you go through the streets[^fn1]
- No one recognizes you.
- No one sees your crystal crown, no one looks[^fn2]
- At the carpet of red gold
- That you tread as you pass,
- The nonexistent carpet.

- And when you appear
- All the rivers sound[^fn3]
- In my body, bells
- Shake the sky,[^fn4]
- And a hymn fills the world.

- Only you and I,
- Only you and I, my love,
- Listen to it.[^fn5]
