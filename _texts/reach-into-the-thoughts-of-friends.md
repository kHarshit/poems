- Reach into the thoughts of friends,
- And find they do not know your name.
- Squeeze the teddy bear too tight,
- And watch the feathers burst the seams.
- Touch the stained glass with your cheek,
- And feel its chill upon your blood.
- Hold a candle to the night,
- And see the darkness bend the flame.
- Tear the mask of peace from God,
- And hear the roar of souls in hell.
- Pluck a rose in name of love,
- And watch the petals curl and wilt.
- Lean upon the western wind,
- And know you are alone.
