- Where the mind is without fear
- and the head is held high,
- where knowledge is free.
- Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls.
- Where words come out from the depth of truth,
- where tireless striving stretches its arms toward perfection.
- Where the clear stream of reason has not lost it's way
- into the dreary desert sand of dead habit.
- Where the mind is led forward by thee
- into ever widening thought and action.
- In to that heaven of freedom, my father,
- LET MY COUNTRY AWAKE!
