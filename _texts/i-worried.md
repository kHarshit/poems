- I worried a lot. Will the garden grow, will the rivers
- flow in the right direction, will the earth turn
- as it was taught, and if not how shall
- I correct it?

- Was I right, was I wrong, will I be forgiven,
- can I do better?

- Will I ever be able to sing, even the sparrows
- can do it and I am, well,
- hopeless.

- Is my eyesight fading or am I just imagining it,
- am I going to get rheumatism,
- lockjaw, dementia?

- Finally I saw that worrying had come to nothing.
- And gave it up. And took my old body
- and went out into the morning,
- and sang.
