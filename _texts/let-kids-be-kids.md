- Let kids be kids; just let them be
- Princesses, pirates; let the bath be the sea!

- Let them stare at the sky and find animals in the clouds.
- Let them dance in the rain and sing out loud.

- Let them dream really big and wish upon a star.
- Let them feel the wind in their hair from the window of a car.

- Smell their dandelion bouquet like it's your favorite flower,
- For they will grow up in what seems like just an hour.

- Tell them bedtime stories each and every night.
- Let them sleep in the middle when they awake with fright.

- Shield them from evil and keep them from danger,
- But teach them of acts of kindness for complete strangers.

- Don't hurry them, overschedule them, and make them feel lost,
- For if this happens it will be you who will pay the cost!

- Let them build castles, do cartwheels, and find shells in the sand.
- If they need a little help, then please give them a hand!

- Let them walk barefoot and the grass tickle their feet,
- For it's the small things in life that will make them feel complete!

- Let them make couch cushion forts and sleep in a tent,
- For this is the way childhood was meant to be spent!

- Let them bring you breakfast in bed, let them burn your toast.
- Someday it will be times like this you will miss the most.

- Teach them how to serve others and be a good friend.
- If you teach all these things, their love will have no end.

- Teach them in life, not everyone will win.
- And when they lose they need to accept with a grin.

- It's not about the money you have and the things you have bought.
- Life is all about lessons that parents have taught!

- So let kids be kids, just let them be.
- And our world will be a better place for you and for me!
