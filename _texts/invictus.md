- Out of the night that covers me,
- {:.indent-2}Black as the pit from pole to pole,
- I thank whatever gods may be
- {:.indent-2}For my unconquerable soul.

- In the fell clutch of circumstance
- {:.indent-2}I have not winced nor cried aloud.
- Under the bludgeonings of chance
- {:.indent-2}My head is bloody, but unbowed.

- Beyond this place of wrath and tears
- {:.indent-2}Looms but the Horror of the shade,
- And yet the menace of the years
- {:.indent-2}Finds and shall find me unafraid.

- It matters not how strait the gate,
- {:.indent-2}How charged with punishments the scroll,
- I am the master of my fate,
- {:.indent-2}I am the captain of my soul.
