- If lovers turned to stone
- Would you still envy them
- Would you run free or sit and gaze
- At the grandeur of their solid smirks

- If lovers turned to stone
- Mere statues in your passing
- Would you stop and wonder why-
- You long for lips of marble?
- And the frozen folds of a flowing dress
- Cold against your fingertips
- Then ponder if life’s meaningful
- Or if it’s better petrified

- This beating heart is only half of a home
- Without a lover
- Made of stone
