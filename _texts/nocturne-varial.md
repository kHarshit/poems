- I came as a shadow,
- I stand now a light;
- The depth of my darkness
- Transfigures your night.

- My soul is a nocturne
- Each note is a star;
- The light will not blind you
- So look where you are.

- The radiance is soothing.
- There's warmth in the light.
- I came as a shadow,
- To dazzle your night!
