- When tomorrow starts without me,
- And I'm not there to see,
- If the sun should rise and find your eyes
- all filled with tears for me,

- I wish so much you wouldn't cry
- The way you did today,
- While thinking of the many things,
- We didn't get to say.

- I know how much you love me,
- As much as I love you,
- and each time that you think of me,
- I know you'll miss me too.

- But when tomorrow starts without me,
- Please try to understand,
- That an angel came and called my name,
- And took me by the hand,
- and said my place was ready,
- In heaven far above,
- And that I'd have to leave behind
- All those I dearly love.

- But as I turned to walk away,
- A tear fell from my eye
- For all my life, I'd always thought,
- I didn't want to die.

- I had so much to live for,
- So much left yet to do,
- It seemed almost impossible,
- That I was leaving you.

- I thought of all the yesterdays
- The good ones and the bad,
- I thought of all the love we shared,
- and all the fun we had

- If I could re-live yesterday
- Just even for a while,
- I'd say good-bye and kiss you
- And maybe see you smile.

- But then I fully realized,
- That this could never be,
- For emptiness and memories,
- would take the place of me.

- And when I thought of worldly things,
- I might miss come tomorrow,
- I thought of you, and when I did,
- My heart was filled with sorrow.

- But when I walked through heaven's gates,
- I felt so much at home
- When God looked down and smiled at me,
- From His great golden throne.

- He said, "This is eternity,
- And all I've promised you."
- Today your life on earth is past,
- But here life starts anew

- I promise no tomorrow,
- But today will always last,
- And since each day's the same way
- There's no longing for the past.

- You have been so faithful,
- So trusting and so true.
- Though there were times
- You did some things
- You knew you shouldn't do.

- But you have been forgiven
- And now at last you're free.
- So won't you come and take my hand
- And share my life with me?

- So when tomorrow starts without me,
- Don't think we're far apart,
- For every time you think of me,
- I'm right here, in your heart.
