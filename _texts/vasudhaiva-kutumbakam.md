- अयं निजः परो वे/ति गणना लघुचेतसाम् ।
- उदारचरितानां तु वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम् ॥

<p align="center">&sect;</p> 

- The world is a family

- One is a relative, the other stranger,
- say the small minded.
- The entire world is a family,
- live the magnanimous.

- Be detached,
- be magnanimous,
- lift up your mind, enjoy
- the fruit of Brahmanic freedom.

## Footnotes

It translates to: ‘He (a particular individual) is either my own (ie. friend, relative, etc.) or otherwise (निजः वा परः ). Such is the calculated understanding of those of limited and small minds (इति गणना लघुचेतसाम्). Whereas, those of expansive and generous lives (उदारचरितानां) see the whole world as their family (वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्)’.
