- The heavens roared with thunder
- as lightning filled the skies
- was this God getting angry
- or Nature's big surprise.

- Is Mother Nature telling us
- the best way that she can
- to stop the interference
- and abuse she gets from man.

- We marvel at her beauty
- each time we look around
- then dig up all her treasures
- from their natural burial ground.

- We forget that Nature gives us
- all that keeps us living
- we take it all and still want more
- but never think of giving.

- We build across the countryside
- progressing every day
- but Mother Nature can't progress
- for man is in the way.
