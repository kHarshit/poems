- If questioning would make us wise
- No eyes would ever gaze in eyes;
- If all our tale were told in speech
- No mouths would wander each to each.

- Were spirits free from mortal mesh
- And love not bound in hearts of flesh
- No aching breasts would yearn to meet
- And find their ecstasy complete.

- For who is there that lives and knows
- The secret powers by which he grows?
- Were knowledge all, what were our need
- To thrill and faint and sweetly bleed?

- Then seek not, sweet, the "If" and "Why"
- I love you now until I die.
- For I must love because I live
- And life in me is what you give.
