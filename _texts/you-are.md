- You're my comfort and my pleasure,
- You're the apple of my eye!
- You're as precious as a treasure,
- And the sunbeam in the sky!

- You're the essence of emotion,
- You're a wholesome honeybee!
- You're the spirit of devotion,
- And you're wonderful to me!

- And it's you I'll hold above me,
- And it's you that I'll adore -
- And you might just say you like me -

- But I think I like you more.

- :)
