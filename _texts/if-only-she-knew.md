- She has her own special way
- Of turning around my terrible day.
- She makes all the bad things go away
- The second that she says hey.

- And when I look into her eyes,
- I see pure beauty with no disguise.
- Just a glance at her makes my heartbeat rise.
- I know for a fact that these feelings aren't lies.

- If only she knew
- How much my love for her grew,
- Maybe, just maybe, we could start something new,
- And then I'd never feel blue.

- And if beauty were inches, she'd go on for miles.
- I'd better catch her before I go out of style.
- I'm going to let my heart be my dial
- So I can tell her what I've been feeling for a while.
