- "Perhaps I'll be a sailor
- and I'll sail the seas between -
- Perhaps I'll be a tailor
- making outfits for the queen -
- Perhaps I'll be a dancer
- and I'll dance the night away -
- I'll find a cure for cancer!
- I'll write myself a play!

- "Perhaps I'll be a writer
- and I'll charge a writer's fee -
- The bravest firefighter
- that you'd ever hope to see -
- Perhaps I'll be a lawyer
- and I'll rank amongst the best -
- I'll build the star destroyer!
- I'll conquer every test!

- "Perhaps I'll be a lover,
- and I'll love my lovely life!
- I'll journey and discover
- with my lovely kids and wife!
- Perhaps I'll love tomorrow!"

- He smiled and looked ahead.

- He softly sighed with sorrow.

- "... or maybe not," he said.
