- Looking up at the stars, I know quite well  
- That, for all they care, I can go to hell,  
- But on earth indifference is the least  
- We have to dread from man or beast.  

- How should we like it were stars to burn  
- With a passion for us we could not return?  
- If equal affection cannot be,  
- Let the more loving one be me.  

- Admirer as I think I am  
- Of stars that do not give a damn,  
- I cannot, now I see them, say  
- I missed one terribly all day.  

- Were all stars to disappear or die,  
- I should learn to look at an empty sky  
- And feel its total dark sublime,  
- Though this might take me a little time.
