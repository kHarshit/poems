- Come, let us hasten to a higher plane
- Where dyads tread the fairy fields of Venn,
- Their indices bedecked from one to n
- Commingled in an endless Markov chain!

- Come, every frustum longs to be a cone
- And every vector dreams of matrices.
- Hark to the gentle gradient of the breeze:
- It whispers of a more ergodic zone.

- In Riemann, Hilbert or in Banach space
- Let superscripts and subscripts go their ways.
- Our asymptotes no longer out of phase,
- We shall encounter, counting, face to face.

- I'll grant thee random access to my heart,
- Thou'lt tell me all the constants of thy love;
- And so we two shall all love's lemmas prove,
- And in our bound partition never part.

- For what did Cauchy know, or Christoffel,
- Or Fourier, or any Boole or Euler,
- Wielding their compasses, their pens and rulers,
- Of thy supernal sinusoidal spell?

- Cancel me not - for what then shall remain?
- Abscissas some mantissas, modules, modes,
- A root or two, a torus and a node:
- The inverse of my verse, a null domain.

- Ellipse of bliss, converge, O lips divine!
- The product of our scalars is defined!
- Cyberiad draws nigh, and the skew mind
- Cuts capers like a happy haversine.

- I see the eigenvalue in thine eye,
- I hear the tender tensor in thy sigh.
- Bernoulli would have been content to die,
- Had he but known such a^2 cos 2 Ïˆ[^fn1]!

[^fn1]: --cause to sigh

The poem is taken from "[The Cyeriad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cyberiad)" in which the constructor Klaupacius, friend and rival of the constructor Trurl, who has created a machine which writes poetry, requests it for one.  

> "Very well. Let's have a love poem, lyrical, pastoral, and expressed in the language of pure mathematics. Tensor algebra mainly, with a little topology and higher calculus, if need be. But with feeling, you understand, and in the cybernetic spirit."  
> "Love and tensor algebra? Have you taken leave of your senses?" Trurl began, but stopped, for his electronic bard was already declaiming.
