- The people along the sand All turn and look one way. They turn their back on the land. They look at the sea all day.

- As long as it takes to pass A ship keeps raising its hull; The wetter ground like glass Reflects a standing gull

- The land may vary more; But wherever the truth may be- The water comes ashore, And the people look at the sea.

- They cannot look out far. They cannot look in deep. But when was that ever a bar To any watch they keep?
